Don't mess with these without really good reason. Even a small amount.
1. JBox2D is the physics engine for the QWOP simulation. It is derived from an old version from around the time QWOP 
was created. It has been altered to be serializable. Also, some memory use has been reduced by assuming a small 
number of rigid bodies.
2. Tensorflow only contains autogenerated code. These are the Protobuf messages from the Tensorflow library, compiled
 for Java using something like: `protoc -I=$SRC_DIR --java_out=$DST_DIR $SRC_DIR/addressbook.proto`. These messages 
 are important for transferring information between my code and the core of the Tensorflow library. A large portion 
 is used for sending information to Tensorboard. The actual neural network Tensorflow code is not contained here. 
 That is fetched by Maven.
